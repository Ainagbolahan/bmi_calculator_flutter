# BMI Calculator

 Goal

The objective of this app is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs.


I am going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.


## Take Away

- Use Flutter themes to create coherent branding.
- Created multi-page apps using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- Extracted and refactor Flutter Widgets with a click of the button.
- Passed functions as parameters and fields.
- Used the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.
- Used custom colour palettes by using hex codes.
- Customised Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.
- Understand Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator.
- Learned about composition vs. inheritance and the Flutter way of creating custom UI.
- Understand the difference between const and final in Dart and when to use each.
